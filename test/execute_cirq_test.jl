    # 1. Check if it fails if the circuit has gates that are not allowed
    # 2. Check if it correctly transoforms all the different combinations of stabilizer state and gates
    # 3. Check if it correctly skips the measurement gate
    # 4. Check if it works correctly if the size of the state doesn't match the size of the circuit
